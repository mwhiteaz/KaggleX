Assesment,Does my state still have to test 95 percent of its students? ,"In short, yes. ESSA requires that a state’s accountability system must measure the performance of 95 percent of students by looking at a variety of indicators. One of the indicators is “academic achievement as measured by proficiency on the annual assessments.” For this reason, in order to measure the overall achievement of 95 percent of students, 95 percent must take the annual assessments.

Assesment,How do the students (up to 1 percent) who receive the alternate assessment count in terms of the state’s 95 percent requirement? ,"As long as they meet the other requirements around alternate assessments (e.g. alignment with the state’s standards), states may count students who are assessed based on alternate academic achievement standards for purposes of meeting the 95 percent participation rate.",State,chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://documents.ncsl.org/wwwncsl/Standing-Committee/Education/ESSA_FAQs_Feb2016.pdf
Standards,What are the related mandates or prohibitions related to Common Core? ,"While states must maintain “challenging academic standards” (floor set as: at least three achievement levels in math, English/language arts, and science), there is a strong prohibition on the federal government using any of its authority to mandate or incentivize the use of particular standards. This prohibition not only applies to standards, but also assessments, curriculum, etc. The bill does note, however, that nothing in the law prohibits states from voluntarily entering into partnerships on standards. ",State,chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://documents.ncsl.org/wwwncsl/Standing-Committee/Education/ESSA_FAQs_Feb2016.pdf
Standards,What kind of alignment is required between elementary and secondary standards and higher education? ,"ESSA requires that states demonstrate that their challenging academic standards are aligned with entrance requirements for public institutions of higher educations (IHEs) within that state. However, the legislation was also clear that this does permit the state’s IHEs to set or determine the state’s standards. ",State,chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://documents.ncsl.org/wwwncsl/Standing-Committee/Education/ESSA_FAQs_Feb2016.pdf
Standards,Are states required to submit their standards for approval by the U.S. Department of Education? ,"No. There is clear language in the bill that no state shall be required to submit its standards to the federal government for review or approval. (Standards underlie the accountability system, which is part of the state Title I plan submitted to the Department.) Again, states must maintain challenging academic standards, but the law is very clear that states are not required to seek federal approval of their standards and can make changes to them without federal approval. ",State,chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://documents.ncsl.org/wwwncsl/Standing-Committee/Education/ESSA_FAQs_Feb2016.pdf
Consultation,What constitutes “timely and meaningful consultation” that must occur with state legislators on the state’s Title I plan? ,"The legislation left it intentionally open-ended so that states could decide what process works best for them. In some states, legislatures could be satisfied by procedures already in place in which the state department of education communicates with them regarding the Title I plan. In others, they may want to set up a new process consistent with state law.

Assesment,"What happened to ""adequate yearly progress"" (AYP)?","ESSA eliminates AYP and NCLB’s 100 percent proficiency goals and instead allows states to establish their own goals and milestones and hold schools accountable based on things such as the results on state standardized tests in reading, math , and science. ",State,chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://files.ascd.org/staticfiles/ascd/pdf/siteASCD/policy/ESSA-Accountability-FAQ_May112016.pdf
School improvement,How do states identify schools in need of improvement? ,"Every three years, states must use the data from their accountability systems (both academic and nonacademic components) to identify those schools “in need of improvement,” which must include the lowest-performing five percent of all schools in the state, schools where one or more subgroups are underperforming, or high schools with graduation rates of less than 67 percent. ",State,chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://files.ascd.org/staticfiles/ascd/pdf/siteASCD/policy/ESSA-Accountability-FAQ_May112016.pdf
School improvement, What happens in schools identified as in need of improvement?,"ESSA requires districts to develop and implement evidence-based strategies—with the involvement of parents and educators—to help schools identified as in need of improvement. As part of this process, districts must also identify any inequitable distribution of resources, such as school funding levels. A state would have to intervene with more rigorous improvement actions if low-performing schools don’t meet the state’s improvement criteria within four years. Under ESSA, the School Improvement Grant (SIG) program was eliminated, but states are still required to set aside 7 percent of Title I funds for school improvement purposes ",State,chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/product-files/Equity_ESSA_REPORT.pdf
Accountability,How do states weight the different indicators in their accountability systems?,"ESSA allows states to decide how much weight to give their accountability system components, such as student test results and English learner proficiency, but requires that academic factors, in the aggregate, be given more “substantial weight” than nonacademic indicators. Thus, if a state were to measure school climate and student access to advanced coursework as part of its accountability system, results on state tests , English learner proficiency rates, and graduation rates would have to be given greater weight. How much more weight? The U.S. Department of Education may define what “substantial weight” means through the regulatory process.",State,chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/product-files/Equity_ESSA_REPORT.pdf
Accountability,Are all students required to be tested for accountability purposes? ,"ESSA affirms states’ authority over the policies governing parents “opting” their children out of state standardized tests, but it maintains the requirement that 95 percent of children in each school, as well as 95 percent of students in each subgroup, be tested. The big change from NCLB is that schools will not be subject to federally prescribed corrective action if they fail to meet the 95 percent participation rate. Instead, states will establish their own consequences for schools that fail to meet this requirement.",State,chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/product-files/Equity_ESSA_REPORT.pdf

History,When did ESEA begin?,"The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was signed into law in 1965 by President Lyndon Baines Johnson, who believed that ""full educational opportunity"" should be ""our first national goal."" From its inception, ESEA was a civil rights law. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) is a US law passed in December 2015 that governs the United States K–12 public education policy.[1] The law replaced its predecessor, the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). Like the No Child Left Behind Act, ESSA is a reauthorization of the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which established the federal government's expanded role in public education.

Title I,What is a Title I school?,"In the United States, a Title I school is a school receiving federal funds under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). These funds are allocated to schools with a high percentage of students from low-income families. The purpose is to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards. Title I schools receive additional resources to support programs that supplement the regular education program to improve the academic achievement of struggling learners, particularly in the areas of reading and math. These resources may include additional teachers, intervention programs, and professional development for staff. The focus of Title I is on improving the academic achievement of the disadvantaged. Schools with higher percentages of such students receive more funds. The intention is to level the educational playing field and provide equal opportunities for students who might be at a disadvantage due to socioeconomic factors. In Australia, there might not be an exact equivalent to Title I schools, but you likely have similar initiatives or programs aimed at providing additional resources to schools in lower-income areas to support their students' educational needs.",General,"https://www.azed.gov/titlei/schoolwide#:~:text=A%20school%20with%20a%20Title,children%20are%20from%20low%2Dincome"

Title I,How is it different teaching in a Title I vs a more affluent school?,"Teaching in Title 1 schools, particularly those marked by poverty and lower academic achievement, presents unique challenges compared to non-Title 1 institutions and Title 1 schools with higher performance records. In high poverty Title 1 schools, because students experience higher levels of trauma than their more well-off counterparts, inappropriate student behaviors occur more frequently. While teachers in all schools share akin duties and responsibilities, from my experience and from talking to other educators, teachers in low performing, high poverty Title 1 schools spend significantly more time engaged in teacher responsibilities than teachers who work in non-Title 1 schools.",General,https://acapfulofcurriculum.com/working-in-title-1-schools/

Title I,Is classroom mananagement and issue in Title I schools?,"Our district is entirely Title 1, but there is still a huge variety in school culture. Some of our schools have extremely involved, entitled, micromanaging parents. Others don't. In my experience, teaching is hard all around no matter what kind of school you are at; you're just trading one difficulty for another. Compared to Title 1 schools, teaching in a more ""typical"" school, or even a high-achieving one is just easier. The disrespect and disciplary issues that you experience there are nothing compared to Title 1, and the students themselves are mostly on-grade level.",General,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/15eleyh/teach_in_a_title_1_school_but_dont_send_your_kids/
Title I,What's it like working in a Title I school?,"At a Title I school, we were all extremely micromanaged by the principal, and morale was low.

Title I,Why do Title I schools remain poor?,"Inadequate targeting of Title I funds to high-poverty schools may be the result of several factors, ranging from the way Congress allocates funds across the four Title I formulas to intricate details within each formula. Some of these details—such as the use of adjusted state per-pupil expenditure (SPPE) and methods for counting formula children in the district—are well-intentioned. However, they have unintended consequences that could diminish how well funds are targeted to students living in poverty. Others, such as the “poverty quintiles” used in the Targeted Grant and Education Finance Incentive Grant (EFIG) formulas are outdated and worthy of revision.",General,https://all4ed.org/publication/title-i-of-esea-targeting-funds-to-high-poverty-schools-and-districts/
Title I,What is wrong with Title I funding?,"The current version of Title I is becoming an anachronism. Its embrace of an inflated federal role in education emerged in a political environment that has expired. Schools face very different challenges today, especially when it comes to families distrusting schools and educators. That problem must be handled locally, not constrained by Washington. Despite the general ineffectiveness of Title I funding, there will be strong opposition to eliminating it entirely, which would be seen as a diminution of support for education. If the federal government is to continue using Title I as a vessel for education funding, it should be limited to initial intent—helping students in high-poverty schools.",General,https://manhattan.institute/article/title-i-is-a-clunky-overbroad-failure-low-income-students-deserve-better

The federal government provides less than 10% of funding in most states, including California. ",General,https://www.pgpf.org/budget-basics/how-is-k-12-education-funded
Assesment,What are the testing requirements in ESSA?,"ESSA requires states to test students in reading and math annually in grades 3-8 and once in high school. States must also test kids in science once during elementary school, once in middle school and once in high school. They can use their own state test, or a nationally recognized test like the SAT or ACT. The law also encourages states to get rid of unnecessary testing and provides funds for them to audit their current situation (i.e., how many tests are required at the state, district, and school level, which are redundant, etc.)",,
Accountability,How do states measure school performance?,"States have to measure school performance based on several factors—some academic and at least one non-academic factor that gets at “school quality.” They’ll look at test scores to see how many students are on grade level for reading and math, how many students are showing growth (even if they’re not quite on grade level), how non-native English speakers are progressing in their grasp of the language, and high school graduation rates. The non-academic factor or factors can be whatever states want (it doesn’t even have to be supported by research), but a lot of states appear to be leaning toward things like chronic absenteeism, school safety, parent or student engagement surveys, etc. The academic factors have to be given a greater “weight” or priority over non-academic factors in the school’s overall rating. In other words, student achievement and growth scores can’t count for the same amount as chronic absenteeism, for example.",General,"https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/product/identifying-schools-support-and-intervention-brief#:~:text=Under%20the%20Every%20Student%20Succeeds%20Act%2C%20states,accountability%20based%20on%20multiple%20indicators%20of%20educational"
Accountability,How are schools designated for improvement?,"Based on the overall performance of a school, looking at all of these factors, states must identify the schools that are struggling the most, the bottom 5 percent, and provide comprehensive support—however a state wants to define that is up to them, but it’s the highest level of support. Schools that don’t fit into the bottom 5 percent, but have subgroups of students (e.g., black, Hispanic, low-income, etc.) who are struggling will be identified for “targeted support.” Targeted support is also defined by each state, but it’s one step down from the most comprehensive support states will give the schools struggling the most",General,https://all4ed.org/blog/screened-out-how-some-states-may-limit-the-schools-and-students-identified-for-support/
Needs assessment,What do schools use to find local needs?,"The LEA shall use student data, school data, educator data, and other indicators to review annually the progress of each school and identify needs. LEAs are required to address the learning needs of all students, including children with disabilities, English learners, and gifted and talented students, and should examine relevant data to understand students’ and educators’ most pressing needs, including the potential root causes of those needs given local context. Particular attention should be devoted to students who are failing or at risk of failing to meet the challenge of the college and career ready standards and any other factors",,https://www.everystudentsucceedsact.org/title-1-
Title II,What must a district do for Title II?,"The LEA provides a description of professional development activities that will be made available to teachers, superintendents, principals, and paraprofessionals in order to increase student achievement and eliminate the achievement gap in core academic areas between low-income and minority students and their peers",,ESSA law
Title I,What about private schools in Title I?,"The LEA engages in timely and meaningful consultation with all private schools in its area regarding funds available under ESEA to address the needs of the private school students and staff members. The LEA shall provide eligible private school children, teachers, and other educational personnel, services that address their needs under ESEA and are equitable to the services provided to participating public school children, teachers, and other educational personnel",,
ESSA general,Are there school innovations under ESSA?,"Under ESSA, schools continue to have the flexibility to teach students in different ways. And school innovations can help kids with learning and attention issues. For example, ESSA supports Universal Design for Learning (UDL). This is an approach that offers students many ways to learn the same material. UDL isn’t just helpful for students in special education. It allows all students to use different methods to show what they know. And that gives them an equal chance to succeed in school. ESSA also encourages states to expand personalized learning. This approach aims to meet students where they are. It allows kids to learn",General,Every-Student-Succeeds-Act-ESSA-What-You-Need-to-Know.pdf (coordinatingcenter.org)
Funding,What are the Reading and Literacy Programs Under ESSA?,"ESSA provides funding for a number of optional programs to assist schools. This includes two important reading and literacy programs for students who need more help in these areas. Comprehensive Center on Literacy: One way the law tries to help students, particularly those in special education, is with the creation of a national center for literacy and reading issues. This center will act as a clearinghouse for information on areas related to literacy and students with disabilities. When it’s up and running, the center will be a go-to resource for parents and teachers. Literacy Education Grant Program: ESSA provides literacy grants to states. In 2016, $160 million was given for evidence based literacy instruction. The funding is expected to go to schools this year. This means educators will have the tools to teach skills for reading comprehension like phonological awareness, decoding, and reading fluency.",General,Every-Student-Succeeds-Act-ESSA-What-You-Need-to-Know.pdf (coordinatingcenter.org)
Assesment,What is the requirement for testing under ESSA?,"Annual Testing Under ESSA, states must test students. But the number and kinds of tests depend on the grade level of the child. States must test students in reading and math once a year, in grades 3 through 8, as well as once in high school. They must also test kids in science once in grade school, middle school, and high school. Also, states must provide accommodations on these tests and list them in students’ IEPs or 504 plans. Only 1 percent of students can be given “alternate tests.” These tests are different from the state’s general education tests. Just a small number of kids with cognitive disabilities take these kinds of assessments. These tests aren’t usually for students with learning and attention issues.",General,Every-Student-Succeeds-Act-ESSA-What-You-Need-to-Know.pdf (coordinatingcenter.org)
Accountability,What are report cards?,"State and Local Report Cards ESSA requires that each state and school district publish report cards. This is a big part of the law. This means states and local school districts must have public information available on how schools are doing. Among other things, the following must be reported: Test score results High school graduation rates School funding information Teacher qualifications The report cards also give details on “subgroups” of students. This includes minority students, kids in poverty, those learning English and students in special education. If a state identifies a school or subgroup as struggling, it must notify parents. This is important for students with disabilities. The report cards will show parents how well or poorly schools are serving their kids.",General,Every-Student-Succeeds-Act-ESSA-What-You-Need-to-Know.pdf (coordinatingcenter.org)
Parental involvement,What is the role of parents in ESSA?,"ESSA requires states to let parents get involved in the accountability process for schools. Their input will help ensure that schools pay attention to kids in special education. ESSA requires states to include parents in the accountability process in two key areas: State and local plans: Parents can weigh in on how their state and school district deal with goals for achievement, accountability, and struggling students. State and school district report cards: Parents have a say in the report cards their state and school district.",General,Every-Student-Succeeds-Act-ESSA-What-You-Need-to-Know.pdf (coordinatingcenter.org)

New funding and programs for school improvement under ESSA provide more flexibility for Local Education.",General,parent-discussion-framework.pdf (pta.org)
Accountability,What must states report about schools under ESSA?,"Under ESSA, states are required to report on how each school is performing, how the district is performing, and how the state school system is doing overall. ESSA requires that schools be measured on specific academic indicators but also at least one state selected academic or non-academic indicator. ESSA also requires that states publically share how every school and district in the state performs on an annual report card. Giving adequate funding to every school is critical to ensure that all schools and students have the opportunity to meet high standards. ESSA can shine a light when funding is not equally distributed and target supports to the schools that need them the most.",General,parent-discussion-framework.pdf (pta.org)
Funding,How are schools funded?,"Grants are based on the number of children in a district’s catchment area who are ages 5 to 17 and either from low-income families or those who are homeless, in foster care, or in facilities for neglected or delinquent children. Some additional children whose families receive temporary support are also counted. These children aren’t always enrolled in the district. A district may get money based on children who are homeschooled, in private schools or alternate programs. But a district with a preschool that serves low-income 3- and 4-year-olds won’t have funding based on those students, because they aren’t old enough. Funding is determined by how many eligible children live in a district, not how many students in poverty attend a particular school.",General,Title I Explained: 5 Things Educators Need to Understand About Federal Money for Students in Poverty (edweek.org)
Title I,What is a schoolwide Title I program?,"Any school with at least 40 percent of its students in poverty can opt to use a “schoolwide” program rather than target specific students using the money. More than 9 out of 10 students who receive Title I services do so through a schoolwide program, but not all of these students are poor themselves. Studies have suggested these schoolwide programs offer more flexibility to district leaders, but many are not trained enough on how to use the money more creatively.",General,Title I Explained: 5 Things Educators Need to Understand About Federal Money for Students in Poverty (edweek.org)
Title I,What are the four types of grants under Title I?,"The largest, “basic” grants flow to any district with at least 10 eligible children, representing at least 2 percent of all school-age children in the district. This inclusive base has been around since the original Elementary and Secondary Education Act, ESSA’s predecessor, and was intended to build broad political support for money to help educate low-income children. “Concentration” grants go to districts with more than 6,500 eligible chlidren, or 15 percent of all school-age children living in the district. “Targeted” grants use a weighting system that favors districts with either high numbers or percentages of eligible children, whichever is larger. “Education Finance Incentive Grants,” commonly dubbed “EFIGs,” go through the most complex process. This grant is also weighted to favor districts with higher numbers or percentages of eligible children, but it also adjusts the grants to favor states that spend more per capita on education and those where there is a smaller gap between the districts that spend the most and least per pupil. Targeted and EFIG grants are more likely than basic or concentration grants to push money toward the areas of highest poverty.",General,Title I Explained: 5 Things Educators Need to Understand About Federal Money for Students in Poverty (edweek.org)

Title I,How do students qualify for Title I?,"The federal government divides low-income children into two groups: free lunch and reduced lunch. If a family is living at 130% above the federal poverty line or below, the children in that family are eligible for lunch at no cost. If a family is living at up to 185% above the poverty line, the children in that family are eligible for lunch at a reduced cost. In order to receive this benefit, parents or guardians must fill out an application with information about family size and income. This is typically referred to as “targeted assistance.”",General,EXPLAINED: What Is Title I and How Is It Used to Fund Our Schools? (edpost.com)
Title I,How does a school district qualify for Title I?,"If a district finds, through targeted assistance or parent applications, that a minimum of 10 students per school, or at least 2% of school-age children in the district, are eligible for free or reduced lunch, then the district receives a grant of Title I money which is sent from the federal government to the state department of education. The district must use this supplemental funding for research-based strategies to improve achievement for those students (typically instruction and professional development). The district also has to explain how it will promote parent involvement in its Title I program. ",General,EXPLAINED: What Is Title I and How Is It Used to Fund Our Schools? (edpost.com)
Title I,Is there a new way for school districts to qualify for Title I?,"In 2010 the Obama administration added an eligibility option through the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act called a Community Eligibility Provision (CEP). Under CEP, if 40% of a district’s students are “directly identified” as eligible for free lunch (a stricter way of certifying a family’s poverty status), all students in that district, regardless of family’s income, are eligible for free lunch. Additionally, if a school district is eligible through CEP, the whole school is eligible for compensatory funding, even kids in the school who aren’t low-income. In this case, all teachers, aides, and administrators focus on raising the achievement level of all students.",General,EXPLAINED: What Is Title I and How Is It Used to Fund Our Schools? (edpost.com)
Title I,How do schools calculate which kids are low-income?,The federal government gives schools a choice of five ways: They can use the number of school-age children identified in the most recent census as “low-income”; they can use the number of children who qualify for free and reduced lunch under the National School Lunch Program; they can use the number of children who receive TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families); they can use the number of children eligible for Medicaid; or they can use the Community Eligibility Provision.,General,EXPLAINED: What Is Title I and How Is It Used to Fund Our Schools?

Standards,How many states are including “school climate” in their ESSA accountability systems?,"ESSA told states they had to pick an indicator of school quality or student success to measure alongside test scores. Most states picked chronic absenteeism and/or college and career readiness. At least four say they are incorporating “school climate” specifically into school ratings, including Illinois (which is measuring climate through surveys), Maryland (which is also using surveys), Montana (where school climate is part of a broader measure of “program quality” that also includes reducing behavior issues and increasing engagement), and New Mexico (which is gauging school climate through “Opportunity to Learn” surveys).",General,Answering Your ESSA Questions (edweek.org)
Teachers,Must teachers still be “highly-qualified” under ESSA?,"No.  ESSA got rid of the No Child Left Behind mandate that teachers must be “highly qualified,” which typically meant they needed to have a bachelor’s degree in the subject they were teaching and state certification. Instead, states must come up with their own definition of an “effective teacher.” The federal government is explicitly prohibited from telling states what that can be. ESSA also bars the U.S. Department of Education from interfering with state and district teacher evaluations.",General,Answering Your ESSA Questions (edweek.org)
Standards,"How many states have included science testing in their ESSA plans, and what states will count science in their accountability system?","Every state will have to test students in science. The law, like NCLB, requires states to test students at least three times in science, once in grades 3-5, once in grades 6-9, and once in grades 10-12. Those science tests don’t have to be used for accountability purposes as they do for math and reading.
